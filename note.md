- CORSA is worked, but the accuracy is very low. Maybe increasing data will gain a higher performance.
- CORSA aims to predict APSECT and SENTIMENT, however it currently predicts ONLY SENTIMENT -> Need to add NER model.
- As ASPECT is specific (Hospitality domain), it is necceassary to fine-tune model to get a great NER.
- CORSA still not use YOLOv8n backbones, maybe this is a root of bad performance.
